I bought this Intel Edison Kit from Yahoo Auction.

This is an IoT evaluation board that is compatible with Arduino.

Subjoin a motor, a LED display, and a hand-made cardboard case, It can feed my cat every hour automatically.

further, I made a smartphone application to remote control this via WiFi.

I spend more money than buy a similar product, but this is more interesting, HAHA!
